# Expo Managed Workflow Incompatibility Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Expo managed workflow projects: incompatibility issues that result in cryptic error messages during development and build processes. The error often arises when developers try to use native modules, advanced build systems, or deviate from the standard Expo managed workflow approach.

## Problem

Expo managed workflow offers a simplified development experience but has limitations.  Attempting to integrate native modules not supported by Expo, manually editing the underlying native project files, or employing advanced build configurations outside the standard workflow can cause unexpected errors.  The error messages often lack clarity, making debugging difficult.

## Solution

The solution usually involves identifying the incompatible component or configuration and either finding an Expo-compatible alternative, refactoring the code to be compatible with the managed workflow, or switching to an Expo bare workflow if necessary.

This repository provides example code showcasing both the problematic situation and a corrected implementation.
