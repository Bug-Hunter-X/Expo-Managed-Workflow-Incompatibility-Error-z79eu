The solution depends on the exact nature of the incompatibility, but it will generally involve one or more of the following:

1. **Use Expo-compatible modules:** If the error is due to a native module, look for an Expo-compatible alternative or use an Expo SDK module that provides the equivalent functionality.

2. **Simplify build configurations:** Remove any custom build steps or configurations that are not compatible with Expo's managed workflow.

3. **Refactor code:** In some cases, the code itself might need to be refactored to use the supported API and functionalities offered by the Expo SDK.

4. **Switch to bare workflow (if necessary):** If the required functionality is simply not possible within the constraints of the managed workflow, consider switching to a bare workflow project, which gives you more control over the underlying native projects but also adds complexity.

Example (Illustrative - actual problem may vary):

// bug.js (Problematic code)
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native'; // Not recommended for managed workflow

const { SomeNativeModule } = NativeModules; 

// ... uses SomeNativeModule ...

// bugSolution.js (Corrected code)
// Use an Expo SDK alternative or a compatible module instead
// Or find an expo compatible alternative for SomeNativeModule
