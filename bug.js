This error typically occurs when an Expo managed workflow project attempts to use a feature or module that's not compatible with the managed workflow. Managed workflow projects have certain limitations compared to bare workflow projects.  For instance, using native modules directly that aren't Expo modules, directly manipulating the underlying Android or iOS project files (outside of Expo's standard configuration mechanisms), or using certain advanced build configurations can lead to this error.  The error message itself might be vague and not directly point to the problem, making debugging harder.
